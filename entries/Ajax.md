#Ajax

Ajax (also AJAX; short for *Asynchronous JavaScript and XML*) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.
